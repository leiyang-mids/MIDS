    "####What is a merge sort? Where is it used in Hadoop?\n",
    "Merge sort is a sorting algorithm which quickly combines two sorted lists into a single list of items. Merge sort benefits from distributable in its least efficient step, which is the sorting of the child lists. The merging of child lists into a single sorted list is done in linear time. Merge sorting is used in the shuffle stage of Hadoop to rearrange keys prior to sending them to the reducer. Key-value pairs from different mappers are sorted at their mappers, and then distributed across the reducers in a sorted form.\n",
    "\n",
    "####How is a combiner function used in the context of Hadoop?\n",
    "Combiners are used for local aggregation during the mapper processes of Hadoop. They are run when the incomplete output from the mapper becomes too large to fit within memory and \"spills over\" onto disk. The combiner is responsible for shrinking the data back down so that the mapper can run faster by keeping data in memory and so that the network operations in the partitioner are kept to a bare minimum. Depending on the size and scope of the problem, Hadoop will run combiners any number of times including zero with no input from the user. For this reason, it is critical that the combiner is able to receive records in the format of the mapper's output and emit data in the same format. The combining operation must also be associative and commutative so that the variable number of runs will not affect the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Give an example where it can be used and justify why it should be used in the context of this problem\n",
    "Combiners can be used in long word-count operations. A typical mapper output for a word-count problem will be greater than the size of the document since it emits each individual word and the number associated with it. Transferring this data across the network can drastically reduce the performance of this operation, as well as making the subsequent sorting operation take much longer. Adding a combiner can reduce the size of the mapper output from being tied to the size of the document to being tied to the size of the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "####What is the Hadoop shuffle?\n",
    "Shuffle happens after all mapper processes complete and before reducer starts, all key-value pairs are sorted by key, and the same key is guaranteed to be delivered to the same reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "####What is the Apriori algorithm? Describe an example use in your domain of expertise. Define confidence and lift.\n"
