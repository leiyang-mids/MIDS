===== ET:10 In the context of ecommerce you have just deployed a new conversion rate prediction model to production. This model (aka treatment model) will challenge the control nodel (i.e., the current model) in AB Test manner to see if it can be produce better revenue. Here is the data that was taken from this live AB Test. 

CONTROL MODEL (our new CTR model)
Impression ID   Revenue  
1                $0.50
2                $0.50
3                $3.00
......               
20000            $3.00
20001            $3.00
3                $3.00
3                $3.00
......
50,001           $3.00
.....
100,000          $4.00

All other impressions in this 100,000 sample resulted in zero transactions and therefore zero revenue. 

TREATMENT MODEL (our new CTR model)
Impression ID   Revenue  
1                $1.50
2                $0.50
3                $0.00
......
50,001           $3.00
.....
100,000          $4.00

All other impressions in this 100,000 sample resulted in zero transactions and therefore zero revenue. 


P-values are a common way to determine the statistical significance of a test. The smaller it is, the more confident you can be that the test results are due to something other than random chance.
A common p-value of .05 is a 5% significance level. Similarly, a p-value of .01 is a 1% significance level. A p-value of .20 is a 20% significance level. For this problem set the p-value to 0.01


Which of the following are true:

(a) Based on revenue there is no statistical significant difference between the Control and the Treatment at p-value of 0.05 for a one-sided t-test
(b) Based on transaction rates (tranactions that generated revenue versus not) there is no statistical significant difference between the Control and the Treatment at p-value of 0.05 for a one-sided t-test

(c) AB testing using differences in revenue for this problem is a  useful means of determining if the Treatment conversion rate prediction model is better than the control model.
(d) none of the above

A 7  
B 8

===== ET:15 
Use Spark and the following notebook, https://www.dropbox.com/s/6s5ph41h74bggwi/Linear-Regression-on-Beer-Data.ipynb?dl=0 to answer this question.

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), also known as mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD), is a measure of prediction accuracy of a model for say a forecasting method in statistics, 
for example in trend estimation. It usually expresses accuracy as a percentage, and is defined by the formula:

MAPE = average over all examples (100*Abs(Actual - Predicted) / Actual)) 

Note when Actual is zero that test row is dropped from the evaluation.

Construct a mean model for target variable CASES18PK. Calculate the MAPE for the mean model over the training set. Select the closest answer.

(a) 200%
(b) 250%
(c) 20%
(d) 180%


===== ET:16
Use Spark and the following notebook, https://www.dropbox.com/s/6s5ph41h74bggwi/Linear-Regression-on-Beer-Data.ipynb?dl=0 to answer this question.

The target variable CASES18PK is skewed, so take the log of it (and make it more normally distributed) and compute the MAPE of the mean model for CASES18PK
Select the closest answer to your calculated MAPE.

(a) 200%
(b) 30%
(c) 20%
(d) 10%



===== ET:17

Build a linear regression model using the following variables:

Log(CASES18PK)  ~  log(PRICE12PK), 	log(PRICE18PK),	log(PRICE30PK)

Calculate MAPE over the test set and select the closest answer.

(a) 4.3%
(b) 4.6%
(c) 3.5%
(d) 3.9%


===== ET:18
Recall that Spark automatically sends all variables referenced in your closures to the
worker nodes. While this is convenient, it can also be inefficient because (1) the
default task launching mechanism is optimized for small task sizes, and (2) you
might, in fact, use the same variable in multiple parallel operations, but Spark will
send it separately for each operation. As an example, say that we wanted to write a
Spark program that looks up countries by their call signs (e.g., the call sign for Ireland is EJZ) by prefix matching in an
table. In the following the "signPrefixes" variable is essentially a table with two columns "Sign" and "Country Name". The goal is 
to join the following tables:

     signPrefixes table with columns "Sign" and "Country Name"
     contactCounts table with columns "Sign" and "count"

     to yield  a new table:

countryContactCounts with the following columns "Country Name" and "count"

Use Spark and the following notebook, https://www.dropbox.com/s/6s5ph41h74bggwi/Linear-Regression-on-Beer-Data.ipynb?dl=0 to answer this question.

#..... Other code...
#Country lookup code

# Helper functions for looking up the call signs

 def lookupCountry(sign, prefixes):
    pos = bisect.bisect_left(prefixes, sign)
    return prefixes[pos].split(",")[1]


def loadCallSignTable():
    f = open("callsign_tbl_sorted.txt", "r")
    return f.readlines()

# Lookup the locations of the call signs on the
# RDD contactCounts. We load a list of call sign
# prefixes to country code to support this lookup.
signPrefixes = loadCallSignTable()


def processSignCount(sign_count, signPrefixes):
    country = lookupCountry(sign_count[0], signPrefixes)
    count = sign_count[1]
    return (country, count)

countryContactCounts = (contactCounts
                        .map(lambda signCount: processSignCount(signCount, signPrefixes))
                        .reduceByKey((lambda x, y: x + y)))

countryContactCounts.saveAsTextFile(outputDir + "/countries.txt")

How can we modfify this code to make it more efficient? Choose one response only

(a) modify line 18 with sc.broadcast(loadCallSignTable())
(b) Use accumulators to store the counts for each country
(c) The code is already optimal
(d) none of the above is correct
