    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "- a. The performance of kNN is worse than a random guess, because the dimension of feature space is very high, and the transformed feature vector is very sparse, thus each sample is not very expressive in the feature space. This setup is not good for a distance-based clasifier like knn to perform well.   \n",
    "- b. A multinomial Naive Bayes model is able to model the distribution of more than two classes, while one logistic regression model can only fit a binary variable, thus we have to use the one-versus-other modeling strategy to build four separate models to predict the probabilities of each class. By combining other 3 classes, it also introduces noise to the model, therefore logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes.\n",
    "- c. as C increases in L1, the penalty on structure complexity decreases, so the weights of each feature will increase."

    "- For unigram (1,1) feature: most words with maximum weights are closely related to the topic; but for strict bigram (2,2): some features (e.g. \"was just\", \"and such\", \"you are\", \"looking for\") are not reflecting the topic at all. \n",
    "- This could be due to those features coincidentally appear in the very topic more often than the others, and those features can potentially bring a lot of noise and affect the performance negatively since they are not reflecting the truth - this is validated by the lower f1 score when using strict bigram word feature.\n",
    "- When we allow single word in bigram (1,2) feature, the best features are all from single word. And there are also a couple of words that are neutral to the topic (e.g. \"hi\", \"up\", \"see\"), and the f1 score is a little bit bette than (1,1) feature.  This indicates that \"bag of words\" model works pretty well with this classifier, since the wording context doesn't really help improve the performance.\n"

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "- top 3 documents with biggest R (smallest predicted probability) are empty message and have no feature, they are singular samples. And it makes sense the classifier doesn't have much confidence in them.\n",
    "- TfidfVectorizer evaluates the \"term frequency–inverse document frequency\" for each word, it increases proportionally when the number of times a words appears in a document increases, while decreases as it appears more often in the corpus. This tokenizer identifies the most useful features to differentiate the text, and we can see that the vocabulary size is also reduced compare with CountVectorizer.\n",
    "- Based on the confustion matrix, we can see that most errors happen between classes 0 and 3, which are *\"alt.atheism\" and \"talk.religion.misc\"*. These two are similar topics and can be difficult to distinguish (I doubt even human being can't tell the topic for some samples). There are serveral possibilities to improve the performance: \n",
    " - from feature engineering standpoint, we need to reduce the vocabulary size to reduce dimension of feature space so that each text vector can be less sparse. Specifically we can:\n",
    "   1. tweak two thresholds (max_df and min_df) on TfidfVectorizer to eliminate some common features as well as singular features. \n",
    "   2. check spelling (using enchant package) to remove misspelled words\n",
    "   3. stemming words (using nltk package) to have better uniformity\n",
    " - from modeling standpoint, we can try two options\n",
    "   1. multiple pairwise comparison - since logistic regression model binary variable, we build six models to compare all pairs between the 4 classes. Then for each testing point, run it through all 6 models and get predicted probabilities for each class, which will have 3 probabilities from the models that compares it with the others. The prediction would be the label with maximum sum probability.\n",
    "   2. ensemble approach - build a groups of models and adjust the weight of the logistic regression to have models put more emphasis on class 0 and 3.  "
